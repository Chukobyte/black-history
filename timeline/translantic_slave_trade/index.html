<h3 id="arrival-of-the-first-recorded-slave-1619">Arrival of the First Recorded Slave (1619)</h3>
<p>1619 is the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown Virginia.  Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both slaves and freemen existed in America before 1619.</p>
<p><img alt="Jamestown Slaves" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Chukobyte/black-history/main/assets/images/jamestown_slaves.png" />
According to <a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/">slavevoyages.org</a>, about 12.5 million africans were forcibly taken and traded for roughly 350 years.  About 10 to 11 million survived the passages.  Of the total that survived, approximately 300,000 (roughly 3%) made it to North America.  Below is a chart of slaves that arrived in America:</p>

<p>He obtained his freedom by 1651 and became a landowner, which opened him up to participate socially and economically (slaves were excluded from for obvious reasons).  He had 4 white and 1 black indentured servant, and eventually obtained legal ownership of a man named John Casor.</p>
