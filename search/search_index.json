Abu Bakr II of Mali (14th Century) According to the Arab historian Al-Umari, Abu Bakr II, the ruler of Mali empire, launched two expeditions to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The first expedition he prepared 200 ships with enough supplies to last a few years. He instructed his admiral to sail to other side of the ocean and to not return until either reaching the far side of the ocean or exhausting the supplies. Only one ship returned, with its captain reporting that the remaining ships were swept up in a powerful current. Determined to see what's on the other side of the ocean, Abu Bakr embarked with 2,000 ships which included sailors, builders, craftsmen, and plenty of supplies. In his absense, Mansu Musa---one of the richest men in history---was put in charge of the Malian throne. Abu Bakr never returned and it is not known what happened on his voyage.

The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man who could dance in spite of his condition. In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar. \"Jim Crow\" became a racial slur towards black people which made it a suitable name for the laws that would come later. These are the words from the song Jim Crow: \"Come listen all you galls and boys, I'm going to sing a little song, My name is Jim Crow. Weel about and turn about and do jis so, Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow.\" Laws The laws of Jim Crow were a combination of state and local statues that enforced segregation and discrimination against black people. Voting Restrictions Poll Taxes: Black citizens were required to pay fees in order to vote. Literacy Tests: These tests were administered to disqualify black voters after anit-literacy laws previously prevents Black people from learning to read and write. Grandfather Clauses: These provisions allowed individuals who ancestors had voted before the Civil War to bypass poll taxes and literacy tests, which definitely excluded black people who weren't allowed to vote beforehand. Housing Discrimination Redlining: Banks and lenders denied Black families loans and mortgages in certain neighborhoods. Institutionalization of Segregation (1896) Plessy v. Ferguson codified the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by the US Supreme Court, but in reality the facilities and services such as education, transportation, healthcare, and public accomadations were anything but equal.","title":"Reconstruction (1865\u20131900)"},{"location":"timeline/reconstruction/#reconstruction-and-the-struggle-for-civil-rights","text":"","title":"Reconstruction and the Struggle for Civil Rights"},{"location":"timeline/reconstruction/#reparations-40-acres-and-a-mule-1865","text":"Special Field Order No. 15 was issues on January 1865 by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman.

It was established by the Virginia Company of London, a company chartered by King James I. The colony had a rough start initially with high mortality rates, but tobacco eventually shaped the town economy turning it to a profitable venture. The initial labor force were indenture servants, which are people who agree to work for a number of years in exchange for a paid voyage to America Arrival of the First Recorded Slave (1619) 1619 is the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown, Virginia. Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both slaves and freemen existed in America before 1619. According to slavevoyages.org , about 12.5 million Africans were forcibly taken and traded for roughly 350 years. About 10 to 11 million survived the passages (80%-85% survived). Of the total that survived, approximately 300,000 (roughly 3%) made it to North America. Below is a chart of slaves that arrived in America: Period Count 1626 - 1650 824 1676 - 1700 3,327 1701 - 1725 3,277 1726 - 1750 34,004 1751 - 1775 84,580 1776 - 1800 67,443 1826 - 1850 1,850 1851 - 1875 476 All 305,326 Many African kingdoms in west and central Africa, such as Mali, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Congo, were suppliers of slaves. Historian David Richardson has suggested that roughly 70\u201380% of enslaved Africans were taken as a result of raids, warfare, or other similar violent conflicts and sold as prisoners of war. Some researchers estimate about 10-20% enslaved Africans were kidnapped. Trading posts and forts were setup along the West African coast by countries such as Britian, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. The types of experiences slaves went through varied depending on the location and owner. In some cases slaves were violently abused and whipped, both male and female sexually violated, subjected to brutal experiments (such as Dr. J Marior Sims, \"the father of gynecology\", conducting surgeries on black women without consent or pain relief) any many others. Slave Patrols (1600s-1700s) Slave patrols were local militias consisting of white males who primary job was to search for runaway slaves. They would patrol most often at night and on weekends, and they were also tasked with preventing and stopping rebellions. Slave patrols were given the authority to stop, question, and inflict violence to slaves who violated slave codes. The first recorded slave patrol was established in South Carolina in 1704. Slave patrols are widely considered to be the precursor to modern policing. Bacon's Rebellion (1676-1677) Anthony Johnson - First Black Slave Owner (1651) The first recorded black slave owner was Anthony Johnson. He arrived in Virginia around the 1620s as an indentured servant. He obtained his freedom by 1651 and became a landowner, opening him up to participate socially and economically. He had 4 white and 1 black indentured servant, and eventually obtained legal ownership of a man named John Casor. The Invention of \"White\" (1681) In Virginia a law was passed where the term \"white\" was first ever used in documents, in which it banned black people from marrying whites. This may not be the first time the concept is used, as the concept of \"white\" slowly evolved as with the caste system white put blacks at the bottom below indentured servants. Fort Mose - First Black Settlement (1738) Fort Mose is the first legally recognized free black settlement near St. Augustine Florida. It was a military outpost for the Spanish as well as a place of refuge for runaway slaves. Residents gained their freedom by pledging loyalty to Spain and converting to Catholicism. Crispus Attucks and the Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770) Crispus Attucks was a sailor and dockworker who became a symbol of resistance in Boston during a confrontation between British soldiers and American colonist. The boiling tensions became fatal and Attucks and other protesters were fatally shot by the British. It is widely accepted that Crispus was the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. The Revolutionary War (1776) There are some historians who estimate about 5000 to 8000 black men served in the Continental Army and other militias during the war, which some researchers estimate about 2%-5% of the army. Estimates of about 3,000 to 5,000 fought on the side of the British as they were promised freedom via Lord Dunmore\u2019s Proclamation . Slave Rebellions (1739-1831) Stono Rebellion (1739) One of the largest rebellions in British North America, 25 colonist were killed and between 35 to 50 slaves were killed before it was eventually suppressed. Gabriel's Rebellion (1800) Gabriel, an enslaved blacksmith, planned a large scale slave rebellion. The plan was eventually found out before it was executed and Gabriel, including 25 of his followers, were hanged. Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804) The first successful slave revolt led to Haiti\u2019s independence, challenging the global status quo on slavery. Nat Turner Rebellion (1831) Nat Turner, who was an enslaved preacher in Southampton Country, Virginia, led a rebellion that lasted for about 2 days. Some estimate that 50 - 60 white people were killed and 100 - 200 black people (some not involved) while the rebellion lasted. Nat turner and those involved were all eventually caught and executed. More restrictions on education and literacy were placed on black people as well as other harsher laws and measures. Abolitionist Milestones and Legal Shifts (Early 1800s) Britain Abolishes the Transatlantic Slave Trade (1807) The British parliament passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act which made it illegal to engage in the transatlantic slave trade. This decision was driven by abolitionist groups such as the Quakers. Slavery wasn't abolished for British colonies until 1834. The United States Abolishes Importing Slaves (1808) Following Britain's footsteps a year prior, The United States passes legislation to end the importation of slaves. Slavery still continued domestically however and slaves were still smuggled into the US. Slave Breeding Slave owners systematically forced slaves to have children after importing slaves were illegal. The Underground Railroad (1830-1865) A network of secret passages and safe houses that helped many black slaves escape to free states such as Canada. Harriet Tubman An abolitionist and social activist who went on about 13 missions to save around 70 slaves including family and friends using the Underground Railroad. During the civil war she served the Union army first as a cook and nurse, and later as a spy and a scout. She is credited by some researchers as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the US during the raid of Combahee Ferry which liberated approximately 700 slaves. The Trail of Tears (1830 - 1850) The Indian Removal Act of 1930 forced the removal of Native American tribes such as the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole. About 60,000 Indians and 2,000 to 5,000 Blacks were forced to move from their ancestral homelands in south eastern United States to present day Oklahoma. The Seminole Wars John Horse John Horse was a legendary Seminole warrior and leader who played an important role, especially in the Second Seminole War, in resisting slavery and leading others to freedom. First Seminole War (1817\u20131818) General and soon to be president Andrew Jackson, invaded Florida to purse Seminoles and runaway slaves. By weakening Spanish control in Florida, this set the stage for the U.S. to acquire the territory. Second Seminole War (1835\u20131842) Triggered by forced removal policies under the Indian Removal Act, the Seminoles waged a prolonged guerrilla campaign in the challenging terrain of Florida\u2019s swamps, inflicting heavy costs on U.S. forces while many retained their freedom by retreating into the Everglades. Third Seminole War (1855\u20131858) Marked by a series of low-intensity skirmishes, this final conflict focused on removing the remaining Seminole groups. It gradually tapered off, resulting in a de facto end to large-scale hostilities, with a small community of Seminoles continuing to live in Florida. The American Civil War (1861\u20131865) About 180,000 Black Americans fought for the Union Army and approximately 20,000 served in the Union Navy during the civil war, which was about 10% of the Union's overall fighting force. It is estimated that a few thousand fought on the confederate side, mostly likely being forced to. Devil's Punchbowl - Slave Concentration Camp The Devil's Punchbowl was an internment camp created by the Union army in Natchez, Mississippi, that held freed slaves. Many slaves died of starvation and disease, with some estimates around 20,000 in one year. Emancipation Proclamation (1863) President Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves free in the confederate states. The slaves in states and territories occupied by the Union weren't freed. End of the War and the 13th Amendment (1865) The Civil War ends, and with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, slavery is abolished throughout the United States. There are some studies that in 1960 the estimated value of all the slaves in the US was approximately 3 billion (90 billion today) which was more that the estimated gold reserves which was roughly 200-300 million.","title":"Translantic Slave Trade (1619\u20131865)"},{"location":"timeline/translantic_slave_trade/#the-era-of-the-transatlantic-slave-trade-and-enslavement","text":"","title":"The Era of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Enslavement"},{"location":"timeline/translantic_slave_trade/#jamestown-virginia-1607","text":"The first successful English settlement in North America.
