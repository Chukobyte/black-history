Back of the Head Abu Bakr II of Mali (14th Century) According to the Arab historian Al-Umari, Abu Bakr II, the ruler of Mali empire, launched two expeditions to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The first expedition he prepared 200 ships with enough supplies to last a few years. He instructed his admiral to sail to other side of the ocean and to not return until either reaching the far side of the ocean or exhausting the supplies.

Quotes About Indigenous Black People Books Aboriginal Race of America (1842) On page 5, about the physical characteristics of the aboriginal inhabitants: It cannot be questioned that physical diversities do occur, equally singular and inexplicable, as seen in different shades of color, varying from a fair tint to a complexion almost black ; and this too under circumstances in which climate can have little or no influence. So also in reference to stature, the differences are remarkable in entire tribes which, moreover, are geographically proximate to each other. These facts, however, are mere exceptions to a general rule, and do not alter the peculiar physiognomy of the Indian, which is as undeviatingly characteristic as that of the Negro ; for whether we see him in the athletic Charib or the stunted Chayma, in the dark Californian or the fair Borroa, he is an Indian still, and cannot be mistaken for a being of any other race.

Each family was promised 40 acres of land and some provisions provided a mule to help with farming. After the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson became president and rolled back the changes and gave much of the land back to its confederate owners. With no where to turn, many blacks entered shared cropping and tenant farming systems while others migrated to other areas. Post Civil Violence After the civil war and slavery was abolished, many black communities and Native American allies found themselves under constant threat still of violent oppression and land loss. Ku Klux Klan (1965) The Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist group founded in 1965 at the beginning of the reconstruction period. Allying with other white supremacist adjacent groups and militias, they engaged in widespread violence, which included threats, beatings, and lynchings, to terrorize Black people and polling places and political gatherings. Colfax Massacre (1873) In Colfax, Louisiana, an armed group of white supremacist had a violent clash with a mostly Black militia at a courthouse, resulting in the deaths of approximately 150 Black people.

The Seminole tribe have already dealt with force removal from Florida by this time and fled to Mexico where they established communities and continued to resist the US army. Jim Crow (1870s) Backstory Thomas Dartmouth \"Daddy\" Rice was a white entertainer who coined the stage character \"Jim Crow\". The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man who could dance in spite of his condition. In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar. \"Jim Crow\" became a racial slur towards black people which made it a suitable name for the laws that would come later.

Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both slaves and freemen existed in America before 1619. According to slavevoyages.org , about 12.5 million Africans were forcibly taken and traded for roughly 350 years. About 10 to 11 million survived the passages. Of the total that survived, approximately 300,000 (roughly 3%) made it to North America. Below is a chart of slaves that arrived in America: Period Count 1626 - 1650 824 1676 - 1700 3,327 1701 - 1725 3,277 1726 - 1750 34,004 1751 - 1775 84,580 1776 - 1800 67,443 1826 - 1850 1,850 1851 - 1875 476 All 305,326 Historian David Richardson has suggested that roughly 70\u201380% of enslaved Africans were taken as a result of raids, warfare, or other similar violent conflicts and sold as prisoners of war. Some researchers estimate about 10-20% enslaved Africans were kidnapped. Anthony Johnson - First Black Slave Owner The first recorded black slave owner was Anthony Johnson. He arrived in Virginia around the 1620s as an indentured servant, which is a person who agrees to work for a number of years in exchange for a paid voyage to America. He obtained his freedom by 1651 and became a landowner, opening him up to participate socially and economically. He had 4 white and 1 black indentured servant, and eventually obtained legal ownership of a man named John Casor. Crispus Attucks and the Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770) Crispus Attucks was a sailor and dockworker who became a symbol of resistance in Boston during a confrontation between British soldiers and American colonist. The boiling tensions became fatal and Attucks and other protesters were fatally shot by the British. It is widely accepted that Crispus was the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. The Revolutionary War (1776) There are some historians who estimate about 5000 to 8000 black men served in the Continental Army and other militias during the war. Estimates of about 3,000 to 5,000 fought on the side of the British as they were promised freedom via Lord Dunmore\u2019s Proclamation . Slave Rebellions (1739-1831) Stono Rebellion (1739) One of the largest rebellions in British North America, 25 colonist were killed and between 35 to 50 slaves were killed before it was eventually suppressed. Gabriel's Rebellion (1800) Gabriel, an enslaved blacksmith, planned a large scale slave rebellion. The plan was eventually found out before it was executed and Gabriel, including 25 of his followers, were hanged. Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804) The first successful slave revolt led to Haiti\u2019s independence, challenging the global status quo on slavery. Nat Turner Rebellion (1831) Nat Turner, who was an enslaved preacher in Southampton Country, Virginia, led a rebellion that lasted for about 2 days. Some estimate that 50 - 60 white people were killed and 100 - 200 black people (some not involved) while the rebellion lasted. Nat turner and those involved were all eventually caught and executed. More restrictions on education and literacy were placed on black people as well as other harsher laws and measures. Abolitionist Milestones and Legal Shifts (Early 1800s) Britain Abolishes the Transatlantic Slave Trade (1807) The British parliament passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act which made it illegal to engage in the transatlantic slave trade. This decision was driven by abolitionist groups such as the Quakers. Slavery wasn't abolished for British colonies until 1834. The United States Abolishes Importing Slaves (1808) Following Britain's footsteps a year prior, The United States passes legislation to end the importation of slaves. Slavery still continued domestically however and slaves were still smuggled into the US. Slave Breeding Slave owners systematically forced slaves to have children after importing slaves were illegal. The Underground Railroad (1830-1865) A network of secret passages and safe houses that helped many black slaves escape to free states such as Canada. Harriet Tubman An abolitionist and social activist who went on about 13 missions to save around 70 slaves including family and friends using the Underground Railroad. During the civil war she served the Union army first as a cook and nurse, and later as a spy and a scout. She is credited by some researchers as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the US during the raid of Combahee Ferry which liberated approximately 700 slaves. The Trail of Tears (1830 - 1850) The Indian Removal Act of 1930 forced the removal of Native American tribes such as the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole. About 60,000 Indians and 2,000 to 5,000 Blacks were forced to move from their ancestral homelands in south eastern United States to present day Oklahoma. The American Civil War (1861\u20131865) About 180,000 Black Americans fought for the union during the civil war. It is estimated that a few thousand fought on the confederate side, mostly likely being forced to. Devil's Punchbowl - Slave Concentration Camp The Devil's Punchbowl was an internment camp created by the Union army in Natchez, Mississippi, that held freed slaves. Many slaves died of starvation and disease, with some estimates around 20,000 in one year. Emancipation Proclamation (1863) President Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves free in the confederate states. The slaves in states and territories occupied by the Union weren't freed. End of the War and the 13th Amendment (1865) The Civil War ends, and with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, slavery is abolished throughout the United States.
