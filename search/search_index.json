It targeted groups such as the Civil Right Movement, Black Panthers, Anti-War Activists, Socialist, Communists, Indigenous Rights movements. This program was only discovered when activists broke into a Media, Pennsylvania office in 1971 and exposed those documents to the press. Operation Chaos (1956\u20131971) Operation Chaos was an illegal Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) intelligence gathering operation targeting civil rights and anti war activists and groups.

Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972) An unethical medical study conducted by the US Public Health Service (PHS) partnered with the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The study included 600 black men who weren't told the true purpose of the stud and their syphilis went untreated for year even though a cure was readily available. Brown v. Board of Education (1954) Brown v. Board of Education rules that segregated schools are inherently unequal, setting a legal precedent for desegregation. Fred Hampton (1948-1969) Fred Hampton was a popular leader of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party. He was known for being a charismatic public speaker, community organizing, and launching social programs like free breakfasts and health clinics, aiming to empower oppressed communities. Hampton sought to build coalitions across racial lines with many different groups and even historically hostile ones such as the KKK. Like many other civil rights activists, he was eventually setup and assassinated with the help of government agencies, with in this case was a police raid in which they shot him while he was asleep. Martin Luther King Jr Martin Luther King Jr. (MLK) emerged as the foremost leader of the Civil Rights Movement through his steadfast commitment to non-violent protest and civil disobedience. His leadership during key events\u2014such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington in 1963, where he delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech\u2014helped galvanize national support for ending racial segregation and discrimination. Not only was MLK assassinated in 1968, but his brother was assassinated 15 months after MLK, and his mother was killed in a church 6 years later. Malcolm X Malcolm X was a provocative and influential advocate for Black empowerment during the Civil Rights era. Initially promoting Black separatism and self-defense, his evolving perspective\u2014particularly after his pilgrimage to Mecca\u2014brought a broader view on racial justice and human rights. His eloquent and uncompromising critique of systemic racism left a lasting impact on the struggle for equality. His life was tragically cut short in 1965, when a group of gunmen fatally shot Malcolm X. Rosa Parks On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus\u2014a decision that was far more than an act of personal defiance. Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a 381-day mass protest that became a turning point in the Civil Rights Movement. Parks\u2019 quiet strength and dignity helped galvanize national attention and set the stage for further challenges to racial segregation. Claudette Colvin A young 15 year old girl who refused to give up her seat in March of 1955, several months before Rosa Parks refusal. After refusing to give up her seat she boldly declared \u201cIt\u2019s my constitutional right!\u201d. She was arrested and forcibly removed from the bus, becoming one of the first women in Montgomery to challenge bus segregation laws. Her story was overshadowed as the civil rights activist at the time believed Rosa Parks was a better fit for the movement. Civil Right Act (1964) The Civil Rights Act is passed, prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Voting Rights Act (1965) The Voting Rights Act is enacted, aiming to eliminate barriers to voting for Black Americans and other minorities. The Black Panthers (1966) Founded in 1966 in Oakland, California by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, the Black Panther Party is formed advocating for self-defense, community control, and social justice. The FBI's COINTELPRO aimed to dismantle parties, stoking hostility between different civil rights and black organization which in some cases led to murders and imprisonment.","title":"The Civil Rights Movement (1940\u20131970)"},{"location":"timeline/civil_rights/#the-civil-rights-movement-and-the-road-to-equality","text":"","title":"The Civil Rights Movement and the Road to Equality"},{"location":"timeline/civil_rights/#organized-programs-targeting-the-black-community","text":"","title":"Organized Programs Targeting the Black Community"},{"location":"timeline/civil_rights/#cointelpro-19561971","text":"A secret illegal Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) program designed to infiltrate, disrupt, and discredit political organizations that it considered to be a threat to national security and social order.

They are known as the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica and they predate the Maya. They created sophisticated works of art and architecture. An example of this are the colossal Olmec heads, which some researchers believe suggests African features. Back of the Head Books Aboriginal Race of America (1842) On page 5, about the physical characteristics of the aboriginal inhabitants: It cannot be questioned that physical diversities do occur, equally singular and inexplicable, as seen in different shades of color, varying from a fair tint to a complexion almost black ; and this too under circumstances in which climate can have little or no influence. So also in reference to stature, the differences are remarkable in entire tribes which, moreover, are geographically proximate to each other.

Abu Bakr II of Mali (14th Century) According to the Arab historian Al-Umari, Abu Bakr II, the ruler of Mali empire, launched two expeditions to cross the Atlantic Ocean. The first expedition he prepared 200 ships with enough supplies to last a few years. He instructed his admiral to sail to other side of the ocean and to not return until either reaching the far side of the ocean or exhausting the supplies. Only one ship returned, with its captain reporting that the remaining ships were swept up in a powerful current. Determined to see what's on the other side of the ocean, Abu Bakr embarked with 2,000 ships which included sailors, builders, craftsmen, and plenty of supplies. In his absense, Mansu Musa---one of the richest men in history---was put in charge of the Malian throne. Abu Bakr never returned and it is not known what happened on his voyage.

After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson became president and rolled back the changes and gave much of the land back to its confederate owners. The 14th Ammendment (1868) This established that anyone born and naturalized in the U.S. is a citizen, which extremely important to the newly freed slaves to be recongnized as fill citizens. Convict Leasing (1860s) To fill the shortage of labor left after slavery was abolished, many states implemented the convict leasing system. Under this system, local and state governments leased mostly black men to private companies, plantations, and industries (e.g. railroads). Black codes were reintroduced after the civil war and many black people were often imprisoned for minor offenses. Post Civil War Violence After the civil war and slavery was abolished, many black communities and Native American allies found themselves under constant threat still of violent oppression and land loss. Ku Klux Klan (1865) The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is a white supremacist group founded in 1965 at the beginning of the reconstruction period. Allying with other white supremacist adjacent groups and militias, they engaged in widespread violence, which included threats, beatings, and lynchings, to terrorize Black people at polling places and political gatherings. The KKK took on many of the same roles as the slave patrols. Colfax Massacre (1873) In Colfax, Louisiana, an armed group of white supremacist had a violent clash with a mostly Black militia at a courthouse, resulting in the deaths of approximately 150 Black people. This incident is just one of many that highlighted the extreme risks associated with Black political engagement during this period. Hiram Revels - First Black Senator (1870) Born free in Fayetteville, North Carolina in 1827, Hiram Revels became the first black American to serve in congress as a senator in Mississippi. Before serving as a senator he had a career as a ministor and educator, and helped to recruit black american regiments for the civil war. Jim Crow (1870s) Backstory Thomas Dartmouth \"Daddy\" Rice was a white entertainer who coined the stage character \"Jim Crow\". The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man who could dance despite of his condition. In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar (blackface). This form of entertainment will become known as minstrel shows. \"Jim Crow\" became a racial slur towards black people which made it a suitable name for the laws that would come later. These are the words from the song Jim Crow: \"Come listen all you galls and boys, I'm going to sing a little song, My name is Jim Crow. Weel about and turn about and do jis so, Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow.\" Laws The laws of Jim Crow were a combination of state and local statues that enforced segregation and discrimination against black people.

It was established by the Virginia Company of London, a company chartered by King James I. The colony had a rough start initially with high mortality rates, but tobacco eventually shaped the town economy turning it to a profitable venture. The initial labor force for the Jamestown were indentured servants, which are people who agree to work for a number of years in exchange for a paid voyage to America. The majority of indentured servants were English, followed by Irish, Scottish, German, and Africans. Arrival of the First Recorded Slave (1619) 1619 is the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown, Virginia. Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both African slaves and freemen existed in America before 1619. According to slavevoyages.org , about 12.5 million Africans were forcibly taken and traded for roughly 350 years. About 10 to 11 million survived the passages (80%-85% survived). Of the total that survived, approximately 300,000 (roughly 3%) made it to North America. Below is a chart of slaves that arrived in America: Period Count 1626 - 1650 824 1676 - 1700 3,327 1701 - 1725 3,277 1726 - 1750 34,004 1751 - 1775 84,580 1776 - 1800 67,443 1826 - 1850 1,850 1851 - 1875 476 All 305,326 Many African kingdoms in west and central Africa, such as Mali, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Congo, were suppliers of slaves. Historian David Richardson has suggested that roughly 70\u201380% of enslaved Africans were taken as a result of raids, warfare, or other similar violent conflicts and sold as prisoners of war. Some researchers estimate about 10-20% enslaved Africans were kidnapped. Trading posts and forts were setup along the West African coast by countries such as Britian, Spain, France, and the Netherlands. The types of experiences slaves went through varied depending on the location and owner. In some cases slaves were violently abused and whipped, both male and female sexually violated, subjected to brutal experiments (such as Dr. J Marior Sims, \"the father of gynecology\", conducting surgeries on black women without consent or pain relief) any many others. Anthony Johnson - First Black Slave Owner (1651) The first recorded black slave owner was Anthony Johnson. He arrived in Virginia around the 1620s as an indentured servant. He obtained his freedom by 1651 and became a landowner, opening him up to participate socially and economically. He had 4 white and 1 black indentured servant, and eventually obtained legal ownership of a man named John Casor. Bacon's Rebellion (1676-1677) Nathaniel Bacon, a rich planter, lead a rebellion which consisted of a group of discontented settlers. They burned the settlement down and caused the governor, William Berkeley, to flee. This event is widely regarded as not only highlighting divide between the wealthy and poor settlers, it is also the catalyst to accelerating the shift from indentured servants to black slaves for the main labor force in America. The Invention of \"White\" (1681) In Virginia a law was passed where the term \"white\" was first ever used in legal documents, in which it banned black and white people from getting married. This may not be the first time the concept is used, as the concept of \"white\" slowly evolved as with the caste system which put black people at the bottom. Slave Patrols (1600s-1700s) Slave patrols were local militias consisting of white males who primary job was to search for runaway slaves. They would patrol most often at night and on weekends, and they were also tasked with preventing and stopping rebellions. Slave patrols were given the authority to stop, question, and inflict violence to slaves who violated slave codes. The first recorded slave patrol was established in South Carolina in 1704. Slave patrols are widely considered to be the precursor to modern policing. Fort Mose - First Black Settlement (1738) Fort Mose is the first legally recognized free black settlement near St. Augustine Florida. It was a military outpost for the Spanish as well as a place of refuge for runaway slaves. Residents gained their freedom by pledging loyalty to Spain and converting to Catholicism. Crispus Attucks and the Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770) Crispus Attucks was a sailor and dockworker who became a symbol of resistance in Boston during a confrontation between British soldiers and American colonist. The boiling tensions became fatal and Attucks and other protesters were fatally shot by the British. It is widely accepted that Crispus was the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. The Revolutionary War (1776) There are some historians who estimate about 5000 to 8000 black men served in the Continental Army and other militias during the war, which some researchers estimate about 2%-5% of the army. Estimates of about 3,000 to 5,000 fought on the side of the British as they were promised freedom via Lord Dunmore\u2019s Proclamation . Slave Rebellions (1739-1831) Stono Rebellion (1739) One of the largest rebellions in British North America, 25 colonist were killed and between 35 to 50 slaves were killed before it was eventually suppressed. Gabriel's Rebellion (1800) Gabriel, an enslaved blacksmith, planned a large scale slave rebellion. The plan was eventually found out before it was executed and Gabriel, including 25 of his followers, were hanged. Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804) The first successful slave revolt led to Haiti\u2019s independence, challenging the global status quo on slavery. Nat Turner Rebellion (1831) Nat Turner, who was an enslaved preacher in Southampton Country, Virginia, led a rebellion that lasted for about 2 days. Some estimate that 50 - 60 white people were killed and 100 - 200 black people (some not involved) while the rebellion lasted. Nat turner and those involved were all eventually caught and executed. More restrictions on education and literacy were placed on black people as well as other harsher laws and measures. Abolitionist Milestones and Legal Shifts (Early 1800s) Britain Abolishes the Transatlantic Slave Trade (1807) The British parliament passed the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act which made it illegal to engage in the transatlantic slave trade. This decision was driven by abolitionist groups such as the Quakers. Slavery wasn't abolished for British colonies until 1834. The United States Abolishes Importing Slaves (1808) Following Britain's footsteps a year prior, The United States passes legislation to end the importation of slaves. Slavery still continued domestically however and slaves were still smuggled into the US. Systemic slave breeding practices began to form to continue to meet the demands for labor. Liberia (1816) The U.S. government sponsored the colonization of a free black Americans country on the west coast of Africa. In 1847, Liberia declared its independence becoming the first republic in Africa. The Underground Railroad (1830-1865) A network of secret network of passages, safe houses, and activists that helped many black slaves escape to free states such as Canada. The Underground Railroad was operated by white and black abolitionist and it is estimated that over 100,000 slaves escaped. Harriet Tubman An abolitionist and social activist who is known as the \"Moses of her people\". Hartiet Tubman went on about 19 missions to save around 300 slaves including family and friends using the Underground Railroad. During the civil war she served the Union army first as a cook and nurse, and later as a spy and a scout. She is credited by some researchers as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the US during the raid of Combahee Ferry which liberated approximately 700 slaves. The Trail of Tears (1830 - 1850) The Indian Removal Act of 1930 forced the removal of Native American tribes such as the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Seminole. About 60,000 Indians and 2,000 to 5,000 Blacks were forced to move from their ancestral homelands in south eastern United States to present day Oklahoma. The Seminole Wars John Horse John Horse, also known as Juan Caballo or Gopher John was a legendary Seminole warrior and leader who played an important role, especially in the Second Seminole War, in resisting slavery and leading others to freedom. After the Second Seminole war, he helped negotiate with the government to secure land and freedom for Black Seminoles in Oklahoma. First Seminole War (1817\u20131818) General and soon to be president Andrew Jackson, invaded Florida to purse Seminoles and runaway slaves. By weakening Spanish control in Florida, this set the stage for the U.S. to acquire the territory. Second Seminole War (1835\u20131842) Triggered by forced removal policies under the Indian Removal Act, the Seminoles waged a prolonged guerrilla campaign in the challenging terrain of Florida\u2019s swamps, inflicting heavy costs on U.S. forces while many retained their freedom by retreating into the Everglades. Third Seminole War (1855\u20131858) Marked by a series of low-intensity skirmishes, this final conflict focused on removing the remaining Seminole groups. It gradually tapered off, resulting in a de facto end to large-scale hostilities, with a small community of Seminoles continuing to live in Florida. The American Civil War (1861\u20131865) About 180,000 Black Americans fought for the Union Army and approximately 20,000 served in the Union Navy during the civil war, which was about 10% of the Union's overall fighting force. It is estimated that a few thousand fought on the confederate side, mostly likely being forced to. Devil's Punchbowl - Slave Concentration Camp The Devil's Punchbowl was an internment camp created by the Union army in Natchez, Mississippi, that held freed slaves. Many slaves died of starvation and disease, with some estimates around 20,000 in one year. Emancipation Proclamation (1863) President Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves free in the confederate states. The slaves in states and territories occupied by the Union weren't freed. End of the War and the 13th Amendment (1865) The Civil War ends, and with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, slavery is abolished throughout the United States. There are some studies that in 1960 the estimated value of all the slaves in the US was approximately 3 billion (90 billion today) which was more that the estimated gold reserves which was roughly 200-300 million.","title":"Translantic Slave Trade (1619\u20131865)"},{"location":"timeline/translantic_slave_trade/#the-era-of-the-transatlantic-slave-trade-and-enslavement","text":"","title":"The Era of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Enslavement"},{"location":"timeline/translantic_slave_trade/#jamestown-virginia-1607","text":"The first successful English settlement in North America.
