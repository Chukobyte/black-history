## Reconstruction and the Struggle for Civil Rights

### Jim Crow Laws (1870s)

#### Backstory
Thomas Dartmouth "Daddy" Rice was an entertainer who coined the stage character "Jim Crow".  The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man, being able to dance in spite of his condition.  In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar.

These are the words from the song Jim Crow:

***"Come listen all you galls and boys,***

***I'm going to sing a little song,***

***My name is Jim Crow.***

***Weel about and turn about and do jis so,***

***Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow."***


### Reconstruction Era (1865–1877)
A period of significant yet short-lived gains in Black political participation, education, and civil rights, as African Americans began to assert their rights in a post-slavery society.

### Institutionalization of Segregation (1896)
The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Plessy v. Ferguson legitimizes the “separate but equal” doctrine, laying the legal groundwork for Jim Crow laws and widespread racial segregation.
