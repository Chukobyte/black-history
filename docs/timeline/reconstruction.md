## Reconstruction and the Struggle for Civil Rights

### Reparations: 40 Acres and a Mule (1865)
Special Field Order No. 15 was issues on January 1865 by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman.  Land was set aside in coastal areas primarily in South Carolina, Florida, and Georgia for the recently freed slaves.  Each family was promised 40 acres of land and some provisions provided a mule to help with farming.

After the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson became president and rolled back the changes and gave much of the land back to its confederate owners.  With no where to turn, many blacks entered shared cropping and tenant farming systems while others migrated to other areas.

### Post Civil Violence (1865 - 1900s)
After the civil war and slavery was abolished, many black communities and Native American allies found themselves under constant threat still of violent oppression and land loss.

#### Ku Klux Klan (1965)
The Ku Klux Klan is a white supremacist group founded in 1965 at the beginning of the reconstruction period.  Allying with other white supremacist adjacent groups and militias, they engaged in widespread violence, which included threats, beatings, and lynchings, to terrorize Black people and polling places and political gatherings.

#### Colfax Massacre (1873)
In Colfax, Louisiana, an armed group of white supremacist had a violent clash with a mostly Black militia at a courthouse, resulting in the deaths of approximately 150 Black people. This incident is just one of many that highlighted the extreme risks associated with Black political engagement during this period.

### Jim Crow (1870s)

#### Backstory
Thomas Dartmouth "Daddy" Rice was a white entertainer who coined the stage character "Jim Crow".  The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man who could dance in spite of his condition.  In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar.

"Jim Crow" became a racial slur towards black people which made it a suitable name for the laws that would come later.  These are the words from the song Jim Crow:

> *"Come listen all you galls and boys,*
>
> *I'm going to sing a little song,*
>
> *My name is Jim Crow.*
>
> *Weel about and turn about and do jis so,*
>
> *Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow."*

#### Laws

The laws of Jim Crow were a combination of state and local statues that enforced segregation and discrimination against black people.

**Voting Restrictions**

- **Poll Taxes:** Black citizens were required to pay fees in order to vote.
- **Literacy Tests:** These tests were administered to disqualify black voters after anit-literacy laws previously prevents Black people from learning to read and write.
- **Grandfather Clauses:** These provisions allowed individuals who ancestors had voted before the Civil War to bypass poll taxes and literacy tests, which definitely excluded black people who weren't allowed to vote beforehand.

**Housing Discrimination**

- **Redlining:** Banks and lenders denied Black families loans and mortgages in certain neighborhoods.

### Institutionalization of Segregation (1896)
Plessy v. Ferguson codified the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the US Supreme Court, but in reality the facilities and services such as education, transportation, healthcare were anything but equal.
