## Reconstruction and the Struggle for Civil Rights

### Reparations of 40 Acres and a Mule (1865)
Special Field Order No. 15 was issues on January 1865 by Union General William Tecumseh Sherman.  Land was set aside in coastal areas primarily in South Carolina, Florida, and Georgia for the recently freed slaves.  Each family was promised 40 acres of land and some provisions provided a mule to help with farming.

After the Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Johnson became president and rolled back the changes and gave much of the land back to its confederate owners.  With no where to turn, many blacks entered shared cropping and tenant farming systems while others migrated to other areas.

### Jim Crow (1870s)

#### Backstory
Thomas Dartmouth "Daddy" Rice was an entertainer who coined the stage character "Jim Crow".  The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man, being able to dance in spite of his condition.  In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar.

"Jim Crow" became a racial slur towards black people which made it a suitable name for the laws that would come later.  These are the words from the song Jim Crow:

> *"Come listen all you galls and boys,*
>
> *I'm going to sing a little song,*
>
> *My name is Jim Crow.*
>
> *Weel about and turn about and do jis so,*
>
> *Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow."*

#### Laws

The laws of Jim Crow were a combination of state and local statues that enforced segregation and discrimination against black people.

There were voting restrictions such as poll taxes, literacy tests (when there were previously anti-literacy laws which made it illegal for black people to read or write), and grandfather clauses which allowed those who could vote before a certain date (usually before the civil war) to skip out on literacy tests and poll taxes, which excluded majority of black people.

Redlining and housing discrimination also prevented black people from obtaining loans for homes and moving to better neighborhoods.

### Institutionalization of Segregation (1896)
Plessy v. Ferguson codified the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the US Supreme Court, but in reality the facilities and services were anything but equal for blacks.
