## Reconstruction and the Struggle for Civil Rights

### Jim Crow (1870s)

#### Backstory
Thomas Dartmouth "Daddy" Rice was an entertainer who coined the stage character "Jim Crow".  The character was allegedly inspired by a crippled black man, being able to dance in spite of his condition.  In 1828, Rice appeared on stage with his face covered in tar.

These are the words from the song Jim Crow:

***"Come listen all you galls and boys,***

***I'm going to sing a little song,***

***My name is Jim Crow.***

***Weel about and turn about and do jis so,***

***Eb'ry time I weel about I jump Jim Crow."***

#### Laws

The laws of Jim crow were a combination of state and local statues that enforced segregation and discrimination against black people.

There were voting restrictions such as poll taxes, literacy tests (when there were previously anti-literacy laws which made it illegal for black people to read or write), and grandfather clauses which allowed those who could vote before a certain date (usually before the civil war) to skip out on literacy tests and poll taxes, which excluded majority of black people.

Redlining and housing discrimination also prevented black people from obtaining loans for homes and moving to better neighborhoods.


### Reconstruction Era (1865â€“1877)
A period of significant yet short-lived gains in Black political participation, education, and civil rights, as Black Americans began to assert their rights in a post-slavery society.

### Institutionalization of Segregation (1896)
Plessy v. Ferguson codified the "separate but equal" doctrine established by the US Supreme Court, but in reality the facilities and services were anything but equal for blacks.
