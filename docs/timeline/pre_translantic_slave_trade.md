### Evidence of Blacks as Indigenous and Pre-Columbian Migration

#### Olmec Civilization (c. 1500 BCE – 400 BCE)
The Olmecs civilization existed along the gulf coast of present day Mexico.  They are known as the "mother culture" of Mesoamerica and they predate the Maya.  They created sophisticated works of art and architecture.  An example of this are the colossal Olmec heads, which some researchers believe suggests African features.

##### Aboriginal Race of America (1842)
On page 5, about the physical characteristics of the aboriginal inhabitants:

> *It cannot be questioned that physical diversities do occur, equally singular and inexplicable, as seen in different shades of color, varying from a fair tint to a complexion almost <u>black</u>; and this too under circumstances in which climate can have little or no influence.  So also in reference to stature, the differences are remarkable in entire tribes which, moreover, are geographically proximate to each other. These facts, however, are mere exceptions to a general rule, and <u>do not alter the peculiar physiognomy of the Indian, which is as undeviatingly characteristic as that of the Negro</u>; for whether we see him in the athletic Charib or the stunted Chayma, in the dark Californian or the fair Borroa, <u>he is an Indian still, and cannot be mistaken for a being of any other race.</u>*

##### The American Nations; Or Outlines of a National History; Of the Ancient and Modern Nations of North and South America Vol 1 (1836)

On page 57:

> *American anthropography will teach that there were men of all sizes, features and complexions, in this hemisphere before 1492: notwithstanding the false assertions of many writers, who take one nation for the whole American group.  The Uskihs, the Puruays, the Parias, the Chons, &c. were as white as the Spaniards, 50 such tribes were found in South America; while many tribes of Choco, the Manabis, the Yururas, &c., <u>were as black as the negroes.</u>  All the other shades of brown, tawny, and coppery, were scattered everywhere.  There was not a single red man in America, unless painted as such.  Some tribes had scanty beards as the Tartars, Chinese, Berbers, &c., other bushy beards.  The Tinguis or Patagons were 7 or 8 feet high, and the Guaymas only 4 or 5 feet.*

#### Abu Bakr II of Mali (14th Century)
According to the Arab historian Al-Umari, Abu Bakr II, the ruler of Mali empire, launched two expeditions to cross the Atlantic Ocean.  The first expedition he prepared 200 ships with enough supplies to last a few years.  He instructed his admiral to sail to other side of the ocean and to not return until either reaching the far side of the ocean or exhausting the supplies.  Only one ship returned, with its captain reporting that the remaining ships were swept up in a powerful current.

Determined to see what's on the other side of the ocean, Abu Bakr embarked with 2,000 ships which included sailors, builders, craftsmen, and plenty of supplies.  In his absense, Mansu Musa---one of the richest men in history---was put in charge of the Malian throne.  Abu Bakr never returned and it is not known what happened on his voyage.  Some researchers, including historian Ivan Van Sertima, suggest that it's possible his fleet reached the Carribean, Central or South America.

### Post Colombus

#### Spanish Colony Rebellion

According to Linda Heywood, co-author of the book "Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the Foundation of the Americas, 1585–1660", commented on a history.com [article](https://www.history.com/news/american-slavery-before-jamestown-1619) about Africans in America:

*“There were significant numbers who were brought in as early as 1526,” says Heywood. That year, some of these enslaved Africans became part of a Spanish expedition to establish an outpost in what is now South Carolina. They rebelled, preventing the Spanish from founding the colony.*
