## The Era of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Enslavement

### Arrival of the First Recorded Slave (1619)
1619 is the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown Virginia.  Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both slaves and freemen existed before 1619.

### Expansion of the Slave Trade (17th – 18th Centuries)
Enslaved Africans were forcibly transported across the Atlantic, profoundly shaping the economies, cultures, and social structures of the Americas.

### Revolutionary Movements and Uprisings (Late 1700s)
American Revolution: While the fight for independence was underway, debates about freedom and rights set the stage for future conflicts over slavery.

Haitian Revolution (1791–1804): The first successful slave revolt led to Haiti’s independence, challenging the global status quo on slavery.

### Shifts in Abolitionist Movements (Early 1800s)
1807: Britain abolishes the transatlantic slave trade.

1808: The United States enacts legislation to end the importation of slaves, setting the stage for further resistance and eventual emancipation.

1831: Nat Turner Rebellion.

### The American Civil War and the End of Slavery (1861–1865)
1863: President Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, redefining the war as a fight for freedom.

1865: The Civil War ends, and with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, slavery is abolished throughout the United States.
