## The Era of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Enslavement

### Arrival of the First Recorded Slave (1619)
1619 is the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown Virginia.  Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both slaves and freemen existed in America before 1619.

According to [slavevoyages.org](https://www.slavevoyages.org/), about 12.5 million Africans were forcibly taken and traded for roughly 350 years.  About 10 to 11 million survived the passages.  Of the total that survived, approximately 300,000 (roughly 3%) made it to North America.  Below is a chart of slaves that arrived in America:
