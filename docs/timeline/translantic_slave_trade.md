## The Era of the Transatlantic Slave Trade and Enslavement

### Jamestown, Virginia (1607)
The first successful English settlement in North America.  It was established by the Virginia Company of London, a company chartered by King James I.  The colony had a rough start initially with high mortality rates, but tobacco eventually shaped the town economy turning it to a profitable venture.

The initial labor force were indenture servants from all background such, which are people who agree to work for a number of years in exchange for a paid voyage to America.  The majority of indentured servants were English, followed by Irish, Scottish, German, and Africans.

### Arrival of the First Recorded Slave (1619)
1619 is the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans in Jamestown, Virginia.  Though it's most likely that this wasn't the first enslaved Africans, as both African slaves and freemen existed in America before 1619.

According to [slavevoyages.org](https://www.slavevoyages.org/), about 12.5 million Africans were forcibly taken and traded for roughly 350 years.  About 10 to 11 million survived the passages (80%-85% survived).  Of the total that survived, approximately 300,000 (roughly 3%) made it to North America.  Below is a chart of slaves that arrived in America:

|    Period   |  Count  |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 1626 - 1650 | 824     |
| 1676 - 1700 | 3,327   |
| 1701 - 1725 | 3,277   |
| 1726 - 1750 | 34,004  |
| 1751 - 1775 | 84,580  |
| 1776 - 1800 | 67,443  |
| 1826 - 1850 | 1,850   |
| 1851 - 1875 | 476     |
| All         | 305,326 |

Many African kingdoms in west and central Africa, such as Mali, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Congo, were suppliers of slaves.  Historian David Richardson has suggested that roughly 70–80% of enslaved Africans were taken as a result of raids, warfare, or other similar violent conflicts and sold as prisoners of war.  Some researchers estimate about 10-20% enslaved Africans were kidnapped.  Trading posts and forts were setup along the West African coast by countries such as Britian, Spain, France, and the Netherlands.

The types of experiences slaves went through varied depending on the location and owner.  In some cases slaves were violently abused and whipped, both male and female sexually violated, subjected to brutal experiments (such as Dr. J Marior Sims, "the father of gynecology", conducting surgeries on black women without consent or pain relief) any many others.

### Anthony Johnson - First Black Slave Owner (1651)
The first recorded black slave owner was Anthony Johnson.  He arrived in Virginia around the 1620s as an indentured servant.  He obtained his freedom by 1651 and became a landowner, opening him up to participate socially and economically.  He had 4 white and 1 black indentured servant, and eventually obtained legal ownership of a man named John Casor.

### Bacon's Rebellion (1676-1677)
Nathaniel Bacon, a rich planter, lead a rebellion which consisted of a group of discontented settlers.   They burned the settlement down and caused the governor, William Berkeley, to flee.  This event is widely regarded as not only highlighting divide between the wealthy and poor settlers, it is also the catalyst to accelerating the shift from indentured servants to black slaves for the main labor force in America.

### The Invention of "White" (1681)
In Virginia a law was passed where the term "white" was first ever used in legal documents, in which it banned black and white people from getting married.  This may not be the first time the concept is used, as the concept of "white" slowly evolved as with the caste system which put black people at the bottom.

### Slave Patrols (1600s-1700s)
Slave patrols were local militias consisting of white males who primary job was to search for runaway slaves.  They would patrol most often at night and on weekends, and they were also tasked with preventing and stopping rebellions.  Slave patrols were given the authority to stop, question, and inflict violence to slaves who violated slave codes.  The first recorded slave patrol was established in South Carolina in 1704.  Slave patrols are widely considered to be the precursor to modern policing.

### Fort Mose - First Black Settlement (1738)
Fort Mose is the first legally recognized free black settlement near St. Augustine Florida.  It was a military outpost for the Spanish as well as a place of refuge for runaway slaves.  Residents gained their freedom by pledging loyalty to Spain and converting to Catholicism.

##### Nat Turner Rebellion (1831)
Nat Turner, who was an enslaved preacher in Southampton Country, Virginia, led a rebellion that lasted for about 2 days.  Some estimate that 50 - 60 white people were killed and 100 - 200 black people (some not involved) while the rebellion lasted.  Nat turner and those involved were all eventually caught and executed.  More restrictions on education and literacy were placed on black people as well as other harsher laws and measures.

##### The United States Abolishes Importing Slaves (1808)
Following Britain's footsteps a year prior, The United States passes legislation to end the importation of slaves.  Slavery still continued domestically however and slaves were still smuggled into the US.  Systemic slave breeding practices began to form to continue to meet the demands for labor.

##### Harriet Tubman
An abolitionist  and social activist who went on about 13 missions to save around 70 slaves including family and friends using the Underground Railroad.  During the civil war she served the Union army first as a cook and nurse, and later as a spy and a scout.  She is credited by some researchers as the first woman to lead an armed military operation in the US during the raid of Combahee Ferry which liberated approximately 700 slaves.

##### First Seminole War (1817–1818)
General and soon to be president Andrew Jackson, invaded Florida to purse Seminoles and runaway slaves.  By weakening Spanish control in Florida, this set the stage for the U.S. to acquire the territory.

##### Second Seminole War (1835–1842)
Triggered by forced removal policies under the Indian Removal Act, the Seminoles waged a prolonged guerrilla campaign in the challenging terrain of Florida’s swamps, inflicting heavy costs on U.S. forces while many retained their freedom by retreating into the Everglades.

##### Third Seminole War (1855–1858)
Marked by a series of low-intensity skirmishes, this final conflict focused on removing the remaining Seminole groups. It gradually tapered off, resulting in a de facto end to large-scale hostilities, with a small community of Seminoles continuing to live in Florida.

About 180,000 Black Americans fought for the Union Army and approximately 20,000 served in the Union Navy during the civil war, which was about 10% of the Union's overall fighting force.  It is estimated that a few thousand fought on the confederate side, mostly likely being forced to.

##### Devil's Punchbowl - Slave Concentration Camp
The Devil's Punchbowl was an internment camp created by the Union army in Natchez, Mississippi, that held freed slaves.  Many slaves died of starvation and disease, with some estimates around 20,000 in one year.

##### Emancipation Proclamation (1863)
President Lincoln issues the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared all slaves free in the confederate states.  The slaves in states and territories occupied by the Union weren't freed.

##### End of the War and the 13th Amendment (1865)
The Civil War ends, and with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, slavery is abolished throughout the United States.  There are some studies that in 1960 the estimated value of all the slaves in the US was approximately 3 billion (90 billion today) which was more that the estimated gold reserves which was roughly 200-300 million.
