## Black History Timeline

### About

This is a high level timeline of Black American History.  I wanted to highlight some things that are not commonly talked about as well as touch on what is well known.  The primary focus will be on the United States (North America), but will touch on all of the Americas at various points to add greater context.  This timeline is by no means comprehensive in details or events, and further research should be done if more information is desired.

I use the term 'Black' to refer to the people who would be considered a slave, less than, or non-white in America, especially up to the 20th century.  The terms 'Black' and 'Negro' wasn't universally used before colonial America.  Over time, Europeans began to broadly classify brown, copper colored, dark-skinned people as Black and those of European decent as White.  The "one drop rule", a legal and social doctrine developed in the antebellum south, stated that any person with a single drop of African ancestry was considered Black.  As a result of this mixed race individuals and in some cases native americans, were classified as Black.
